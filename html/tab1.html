<h4 id="t1">What is dark matter?</h4>
<p id="Darkmatter1">
  It is the type of matter that does not interact with the electromagnetic
  field, that is, we cannot see it, it cannot be reflected, nor can it be
  absorbed by materials. This corresponds to approximately 26.8% of the matter
  in the universe, an example of this is gravitational effects.

<h4 id="t2">What is the importance of dark matter in the universe?</h4>
<p id="Darkmatter2">
  Dark matter plays a very important role and it is in understanding the
  Big-Bang formation model of the universe and in the way space bodies behave,
  it is a compactor of structures. Therefore, if there were no dark matter,
  there would be no galaxies, stars, planets, etc.
</p>
<h4 id="t3">What is baryonic matter?</h4>
<p id="Baryonic matter1">
  It is the ordinary matter that we can see and feel around us, like the matter
  that makes up planets, stars and galaxies, this is made up of baryons, which
  are subatomic particles made up of three quarks, which include protons and
  neutrons.
