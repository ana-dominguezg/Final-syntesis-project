<h4 id="t1">What is dark matter?</h4>
<p id="Darkmatter1">
  It is the type of matter that does not interact with the electromagnetic
  field, that is, we cannot see it, it cannot be reflected, nor can it be
  absorbed by materials. This corresponds to approximately 26.8% of the matter
  in the universe, an example of this is gravitational effects.

<h4 id="t2">What is the importance of dark matter in the universe?</h4>
<p id="Darkmatter2">
  Dark matter plays a very important role and it is in understanding the
  Big-Bang formation model of the universe and in the way space bodies behave,
  it is a compactor of structures. Therefore, if there were no dark matter,
  there would be no galaxies, stars, planets, etc.
</p>
<h4 id="t3">What is baryonic matter?</h4>
<p id="Baryonic matter1">
  It is the ordinary matter that we can see and feel around us, like the matter
  that makes up planets, stars and galaxies, this is made up of baryons, which
  are subatomic particles made up of three quarks, which include protons and
  neutrons.

<h4 id="t4">What is the difference between dark matter and baryonic matter?</h4>
<p id="Baryonic matter2">
  • Baryonic matter does emit electromagnetic radiation and dark matter does not emit any radiation.
  <br />
  <br />
  • Dark matter is invisible but baryonic matter can be seen and is present in everything we see.
  <br />
  <br />
  • The function of dark matter is in the expansion of the universe, while baryonic matter has no specific use.
</p>
<h4 id="t5">What is dark energy?</h4>
<p id="Energia oscura">
  It is a repulsive gravitational force that is present in all space, this type of energy has the utility of accelerating the expansion of the universe due to the gravitational attraction of matter.

<h4 id="t6">
  What is the importance of dark energy in the expansion of the universe?
</h4>
<p id="Energia oscura1">
  Dark matter in the evolution of the universe lies in its influence on the formation of large-scale structures, such as galaxies and galaxy clusters, and has also influenced the expansion of the universe due to its gravitational force, which counteracts the influence of dark energy, which accelerates the expansion of the universe.
</p>
<h4 id="t7">What is radiation?</h4>
<p id="radiacion">
  Radiation refers to the propagation of energy in the form of electromagnetic waves or subatomic particles through space or matter. There are several types of radiation, including electromagnetic radiation (such as light, radio waves and X-rays), alpha, beta and gamma radiation (subatomic particles) and neutron radiation.

<h4 id="t8">Radiation types</h4>
<p id="radiacion1">
  •Gravitational radiation

  •Cosmic rays radiation
  <br />
  •Cosmic radiation neutrino background
  <br />
  •Microwave background radiation
  <br />
  •Electromagnetic radiation

<h4 id="t9">percent</h4>
<p id="porcentajes">
  Percentages for each of these components of the universe
  <br />
  • 68% dark energy
  <br />
  • 27% dark matter
  <br />
  • 5% baryonic matter
