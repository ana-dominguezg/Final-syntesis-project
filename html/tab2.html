<h3>Dark matter</h3>
<h4 id="t10">
  Why don't we know anything about dark matter?
</h4>
<p id="materiaoscura3">
  Dark matter is difficult to detect because it does not interact with visible matter in the same way and is invisible to electromagnetic radiation. However, scientists continue to work to develop new ways to detect and better understand dark matter.

  What was dark matter thought to be in the beginning?
</h4>
<p id="materiaoscura4">
  At first, it was believed that dark matter was simply ordinary matter which did not emit enough electromagnetic radiation to be detected. Subsequent observations indicated that the amount of ordinary matter in the universe is insufficient to explain the gravitational effects observed in galaxies and galaxy clusters.
</p>
<h4 id="t12">
  What are the evidences of dark matter?
</h4>
<p id="materiaoscura5">
  The most important evidence includes the rotational velocity of galaxies, the effect of gravitational lensing and anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background radiation.
</p>
<h4 id="t13">
  How has dark matter been detected?
</h4>
<p id="materiaoscura6">
  This has not yet been detected directly, but the existence of dark matter has been detected through its gravitational effects on the distribution of visible matter in the universe. For example, it has been observed that the rotational velocity of galaxies is too high to be explained only by the visible matter in them.

<h4 id="t14">
  What are the particles that could make up dark matter?
</h4>
<p id="materiaoscura7">
  Although it is not known exactly what particles make up dark matter, several have been proposed, such as axions, Machos, and neutrinos.

<h4 id="t15">
  Who discovered dark matter?
</h4>
<p id="materiaoscura8">
  Dark matter was discovered by one of the greatest astronomers of the 20th century, Vera Cooper Rubin, and was first observed in the 1930s by Swiss astronomer Fritz Zwicky who noticed that the galaxies in the Coma cluster were moving much faster than could be explained by the amount of visible matter in the cluster.

  What is a Compact Massive Halo Object?
</h4>
<p id="materiaoscura9">
  Massive Compact Halo Object is a type of dark matter candidate composed of massive and compact objects, such as black holes, neutron stars or white dwarfs, which are found in the galactic halo and may produce observable gravitational effects on nearby stars.

<h4 id="t17">
  What is Einstein's gravitational lens?
</h4>
<p id="materiaoscura10">
  Is a phenomenon in which light is deflected around a massive object, such as a galaxy or a cluster of galaxies, due to the curvature of space-time This curvature is caused by the gravity of the massive object and acts like a lens that can focus or defocus light passing through it
