<h3>Radiation in the universe</h3>
<h4 id="t18">
  What is a gamma rays?
</h4>
<p id="rayogamma">
  A gamma ray is a form of high-energy electromagnetic radiation that is
  produced by processes such as radioactive decay, nuclear fusion, or supernova
  explosions. Gamma rays have the shortest wavelength and the highest frequency
  within the electromagnetic spectrum.
</p>
<h4 id="t19">
  Where is a gamma rays generated?
</h4>
<p id="rayogamma1">
  Gamma rays are produced in extremely energetic events in the universe, such as
  supernovae explosions, neutron star collisions, black holes, and in some
  astrophysical phenomena that involve the acceleration of particles to speeds
  close to the speed of light.

<h4 id="t20">
  What is the microwave cosmic background?
</h4>
<p id="rayogamma2">
  The microwave cosmic background(CMB) is electromagnetic radiation that fills
  the entire observable universe. It is one of the main pieces of evidence for
  the Big Bang theory, which is the dominant scientific theory that explains the
  origin of the universe. The CMB is low-energy radiation that has a wavelength
  of about 1 millimeter, which means it is in the microwave range of the
  electromagnetic spectrum. This radiation originates from the time when the
  universe was only 380,000 years old, when it cooled enough that atoms could
  first form. Before this time, the universe was filled with hot, ionized
  plasma, emitting radiation at all wavelengths. The CMB was discovered in 1964
  by astrophysicists Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson, who were looking for radio
  sources in the sky. They discovered a uniform signal that they couldn't
  explain, which turned out to be the CMB. Since then, it has been studied in
  detail by many experiments and has provided important information about the
  structure and history of the universe.

  What is the type of radiation emitted by the sun and why this type of
  radiation can be harmful to living beings
</h4>
<p id="rayogamma3">
  The sun emits electromagnetic radiation at various wavelengths, including
  visible light, infrared rays, and ultraviolet (UV) radiation. UV radiation is
  what can be harmful to living beings. There are three types of UV radiation:
  UVA, UVB and UVC. Most UVC rays are absorbed by the Earth's atmosphere and do
  not reach the surface, while UVA and UVB rays do reach the Earth's surface.
  UVB radiation is particularly dangerous to living things because it has enough
  energy to penetrate the skin and damage the DNA in cells. This can cause
  sunburn, premature aging of the skin, and increase the risk of skin cancer.
  Chronic exposure to UVB radiation can also weaken the immune system.
